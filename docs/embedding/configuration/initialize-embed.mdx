To embed Activepieces within your own web app, follow these steps:



## Step 1: Generate a JWT token

Follow the instructions in the [generate jwt](./generate-jwt) page

## Step 2: Configure SDK

Adding the embedding sdk script will initialize an object in your window `activepieces`, it has a method `configure`, which you should call after the container has been rendered.
<Tip>
The following scripts shouldn't contain async or defer attributes.
</Tip>

```html
<script src="https://cdn.activepieces.com/sdk/embed/0.2.1.js">
</script>
<script>
activepieces.configure(
 {
    prefix: "/",
    instanceUrl:"http://your-instance-url.com",
    jwtToken:"GENERATED_JWT_TOKEN",
    embedding: {
      containerId: "container",
      builder:{
        disableNavigation:false
      },
      dashboard: {
        hideSidebar:true
      },
      hideFolders:true
    },   
 }
)
</script>
```



**Configure Parameters:**

| Parameter Name |  Required |  Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| containerId | ❌ | string | The html element's id that is going to be containing Activepieces's iframe. |
| jwtToken | ✅  |  string | The jwt token you generated to authenticate your users to Activepieces. |
| instanceUrl| ✅ |  string | The url of the instance hosting Activepieces, could be https://cloud.activepieces.com if you are a cloud user. |
| prefix | ❌ | string | Some customers have an embedding prefix, like this `<embedding_url_prefix>/<Activepieces_url>`. For example if the prefix is `/automations` and the Activepieces url is `/flows` the full url would be `/automations/flows`. |
| hideSidebar | ❌ | boolean | Controls the visibility of the sidebar in the dashboard, by default it is false. |
| disableNavigation | ❌ |  boolean | Hides the folder name and back button in the builder, by default it is false. |
| hideFolders | ❌ | boolean | Hides all things related to folders in both the flows table and builder by default it is false. |

<Info>
The way navigation works is that the iframe loading Activepieces, will read the browser URL, remove the `prefix`, and use what's left of the route to navigate within Activepieces.

For example, if you set `automation` as the prefix and visit `/automation/connections`, SDK will open `/connections` in Activepieces.
