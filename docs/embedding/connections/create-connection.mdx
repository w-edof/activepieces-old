You can use the embedded SDK to create connections.

## Step 1: Initialize the SDK

Follow the instructions in the [Initialize SDK](../configuration/initialize-embed) in Embed builder.

## Step 2: Call Connect method
After initializing the SDK you will have access to a property called `activepieces` inside your `window` object,
call the its `connect` method to open a new connection dialog as follows.

```html
<script> 
activepieces.connect({pieceName:'@activepieces/piece-google-sheets'});
</script>
```

**Connect Parameters:**

| Parameter Name |  Required |  Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pieceName | âœ… | string | The name of the piece you want to create a connection for.

**Connect Result** 

The `connect` method returns a `promise` that resolves to the following object:

```ts
{
    connection?: {
        id:string,
        name:string
    }
}

```
<Info>
`connection` is undefined if the user closes the dialog and doesn't create a connection.
 </Info>

 <Tip>
You can use the `connections` piece in the builder to retrieve the created connection using its name
